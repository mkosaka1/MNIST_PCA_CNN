# Classifying MNIST Handwritten Digits Using NN and Preprocessing Data With PCA

## What is Principal Component Analysis?
One of the many important concepts in Data Science includes Principal Component Analysis (PCA) which is an unsupervised learning method. It is often used to as a dimensionality reduction method for large datasets or simplify their complexity — this is done by transforming a large set of variables into a small one while retaining most of the variation in the dataset. PCA reduces data by geometrically projecting it onto lower dimensions which in turn are called as Principal Components(PC). This method’s goal is to find the best summary of our data by using the least amount of principal components, by choosing our principal components we minimize the distance between the original data and its projected values on the principal components.

## What is Deep Learning?
Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning, inspired by the structure of a human brain. Deep learning algorithms attempt to draw similar conclusions as humans would by continually analyzing data with a given logical structure. To achieve this, deep learning uses a multi-layered structure of algorithms called neural networks. Whether it’s Alexa, Siri or Cortana, deep learning helps them understand speech and the language. Deep Learning uses different types of neural network architectures like object recognition, image and sound classification, and object detection for different types of problems. The more data a Deep Learning algorithm is trained on, the more accurate it is.

## MNIST Dataset
The (MNIST Dataset)[https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer] (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is one of the more popular datasets among deep learning enthusiasts. This dataset contains 42,000 labeled grayscale images (28 x 28 pixel) of handwritten digits from 0–9 in their training set and 28,000 unlabeled test images.
